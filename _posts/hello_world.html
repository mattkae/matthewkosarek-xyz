  Hello, world!
</p>
<p>
  This is the first test of my simple, static blogging system. My goal is to avoid using anything too heavy and, instead, provide a simple script that will get run whenever I update a blog post. Heck, I could even set it up to a cronjob to refresh them everyday. But perhaps that is overkill for today ðŸ˜†. I am satisfied with how it current works.

  Expect to see some updates on Greek philosophy, emacs, and Linux coming soon to a website near you!
